    <h1>About</h1>
<p><br> 
Name: Sohom.</p>
<p>I started SignalShore in 2017 because I really enjoy reading other
people's blogs and I wanted to have one for myself.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Life is best filled by learning as much as you can about as much as you can!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dont know where I heard it but that really sums up what I try to live by.</p>
<p>I change my mind, review my beliefs and sharpen my opinions often, as
and when I learn new things. I am often wrong about a great many
things; hence the cycle of Read, Think, Reach your own conclusions
keeps repeating.</p>
<p>Writing this blog helps me write better and hence it help me think
better.</p>
<p>This blog is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and
to do it properly.</p>

<h2>"SignalShore" ?</h2>
<p>I asked a friend for something "different". He suggested 4 names. This
was the only one that was available at that point. It's surprising
that this was not my first choice. Now that I think about it, the
hindi word for "noise" is "shore". So I guess I can say its something
to do with signal and noise.</p>
