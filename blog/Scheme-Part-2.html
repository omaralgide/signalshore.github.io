<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S-expression">S-expressions</a> or Sexprs or Symbolic Expressions are used to
represented list like data. This was invented for and popularized by
LISP. Lisp stands for LISt Processing. </p>
<p>A list looks like this <code>(x y ... z)</code></p>
<p>A list can be made up of other lists as well. Like so <code>(x (a b c) (d e f))</code></p>
<p>In Lisp (and any other lisps) every program is a represented as a
list. In-fact this is the one and only style of writing programs in
LISP and this leads to some very interesting properties of lisp
programs.
1. Data and instructions (that work on the data) have similar
   representation within the program structure.
2. You have to pay close attention to evaluation models or how each
   list is evaluated.
3. The whole program can be represented as a tree.</p>
<h3>Program Structure of Lisp</h3>
<p>If we look at the structure of a LISP program we will notice that
there is not proper structure to the code other than the usual LIST
structure and everything within that language (from variables to
procedure calls) are represented with the same structure. This is
interesting because this is directly related to the kind of computing
model this language is based on. Lisp is based on a model of computing
called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda Calculus</a>. It was invented by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alonzo_Church">Alonzo Church</a>.</p>
<p>On the other hand procedural and object oriented languages are based
on a model of computing called the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing Machine</a>. In these
languages there is some structure that lets us differentiate between
what is code and what is data, but that is not the case in
Lisp. Infact in Lisp code is treated as data in the form of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function">higher
order procedures</a>.</p>
<p>Lisp programs are trees. In other words the lists can be represented
as tree such that
- Every list within a pair of <em>(</em>  <em>)</em> is treat as a node in the tree
- The very first element of every list is the first child of that node
  in the tree. This is the operator.
- Every other element of that list is a child of that node and are the
  operators for that operand.</p>
<p>The tree of the expression <code>(+ 2 3)</code> will look like this</p>
<p><img alt="single tree" src="/assets/images/2017-11-30/single.jpg"></p>
<p>A LISP program is very easily parse-able by a computer as Trees do
not need complicated rules for traversal and other operations. In-fact
this sounds almost similar to the parse-tree of a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a>.</p>
<p><em><blue>The Substitution Model</blue></em></p>
<p>This is probably one of the most simplest models of evaluation. It is
also very powerful. It is also recursive in nature. Let us write a
basic definition of the Evaluator.</p>
<p>Let the Evaluator be <code>E</code>. It accepts an expression as input and
evaluates it. Let the expression be <code>expr</code></p>
<ul>
<li>On receiving an expression <em>expr</em> evaluate the sub-expressions (using
  the same model; so this is a recursive call to <em><code>E(sub_expr)</code></em> where
  <em>sub_expr</em> is the sub expression)</li>
<li>Apply the results of the sub-lists as operands to the operator of this list.</li>
</ul>
<p>In list the first element of any List is treated as the operator while
the rest are treated as the operands.</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; (+ 2 3 4) ;; + is the operator and 2, 3, 4 are the operands</span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; 9</span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; (* 2 3 4) ;; * is the operator and 2, 3, 4 are the operands</span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; 24</span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; (&amp;gt; 2 3)   ;; &amp;gt; is the operator; this is equivalent to 2 &amp;gt; 3 </span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; f</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This also applied for lists that have other lists in them. Let's have
a look!</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; (+ 2 3 (+ 2 2))</span>
<span class="nv">&amp;gt</span><span class="c1">; 9</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>Let us trace what happens here.  First the evaluator receives the
expression <code>(+ 2 4 (+ 2 2))</code> and then it evaluates the internal list
first. Which is <code>(+ 2 2)</code>. This expression evaluates to <code>4</code>.</p>
<p>In the tree form this is how the above expression would look</p>
<p><img alt="double" src="/assets/images/2017-11-30/double.jpg"></p>
<p>Then the evaluator <em>substitutes</em> that result to the actual expression
before continuing on with the evaluation. So now the expression looks
like this <code>(+ 2 4 4)</code> and then we get the final answer.</p>
<h3>Evaluation Strategies</h3>
<p>Lisp uses an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Applicative_order">Eager evaluation</a> strategy. This is also known as Strict
Evaluation or Applicative evaluation. In this strategy all the
operands are evaluated first before applying them to the function.</p>
<p>In lisp this is the only structure that we have. So conditional
branching (if-else, case). The if-construct in LISP looks like this.</p>
<p><code>(if (expression) (expression1) (expression2))</code></p>
<p>Now the <em>if</em> macro is special because it does not follow the normal
evaluation strategy i.e. all the three expressions <em>expression</em>,
<em>expression1</em> and <em>expression2</em> are not evaluated before the procedure
is applied. In this macro only the first expression (<em>expression</em>) is
evaluated first and if it evaluates to be true (<em>#t</em>) then
<em>expression1</em> will be evaluated. Otherwise <em>expression2</em> will be
evaluated.</p>

    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">if </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recursive</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">- </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recursive</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>What happens when we evaluate the last expression ? Nothing
spectacular. We just get the value <code>0</code> which is what it is supposed to
do. We get this answer only because LISP uses normal order evaluation
(lazy evaluation) for the <em>if</em> construct. If like the default strategy
it used applicative order evaluation then both the <code>0</code> and the <code>(recursive
(- x 1))</code> would be evaluated before calling the procedure and that
would lead to an infinite loop. But the if-constructs uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy#Non-strict_evaluation">Normal order</a> evaluation or non-strict evaluation.</p>
<p>My next program will illustrate this. For that we will define a
<code>new-if</code> procedure that will do exactly what <code>if</code> does.</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">new-if</span> <span class="nv">predicate</span> <span class="nv">exp1</span> <span class="nv">exp2</span><span class="p">)</span> 
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">cond </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">predicate</span> <span class="nv">exp1</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="k">else </span><span class="nv">exp2</span><span class="p">)))</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>This is the <em>new-if</em> procedure. Let us use this in our previous program.</p>
<table class="highlighttable"><tr><td class="linenos"><div class="linenodiv"><pre>1
2
3
4
5
6</pre></div></td><td class="code"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">define </span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recursive-new</span> <span class="nv">x</span><span class="p">)</span>
    <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">new-if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">= </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="mi">0</span>
        <span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recursive-new</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">- </span><span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">))))</span>

<span class="p">(</span><span class="nf">recursive-new</span> <span class="nv">x</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</td></tr></table>

<p>What happens now ? </p>
<p><strong>NOW</strong> the thing goes into a spectacular infinite loop. That is
because the <em>new-if</em> procedure will be evaluated using the applicative
order strategy. Thus all the operands will be evaluated before the
<em>new-if</em> procedure is called; and <em>recursive-new</em> has a call to
itself. So in the end it all splatters exceptionally well.</p>
<p>P.S. I have written this post based on my own
experience which is a very very limited one. I do not claim that what
I have just said is the ultimate truth or the <em>only</em> thing out
there. My short life and my shorter experience with LISP is not nearly
enough to cover the full depth and breadth of LISP</p></div>
