<p>I live in Bangalore as I am studying in Bangalore. My hometown is Kolkata. I keep visiting Kolkata after every semester break which generally lasts for about 3 weeks. </p>
<h3>The Decision</h3>
<p>Coming to Bangalore was not a properly planned decision. Generally moving to a new city for studies is an option that everyone has discussed at-least once in their lifetime. But not me. During my higher-secondary schooling the I had never even entertained the idea of moving to another city to study for an under-graduate degree. Planning and coming to Bangalore happened in like 1 month after my CBSE class 12 results. </p>
<h3>The Blunder</h3>
<p>During my school days I was always a shut-in and avoided social interactions mostly because I did not like my friends too much to begin with and because I really did not fit into any particular group of friends. So to keep my young self sane I said to myself that I would find a decent friends circle when I would be in college and we all would hang out in and around Kolkata and explore the city and what not.</p>
<p>So when coming to Bangalore was finalized I felt very happy. I was very very exited. But that excitement was short-lived. </p>
<h3>The Realization</h3>
<p>After living in Bangalore I soon realized how much I liked Kolkata; not because I did not like Bangalore but because I did not know Kolkata well enough to begin with. These two cities are very very different and comparing them is like comparing apples to bananas. I also felt extremely saddened by the fact that all those plans I made about exploring kolkata and stuff were just 3000 kilometers away. </p>
<h3>The Remedy</h3>
<p>So I decided that every semester break when I go to Kolkata I will trek around the city exploring it. My idea of exploring a city is somewhat different from the conventional idea. I do not follow a guide to the "must-visit" attractions. Rather I pick a place and I walk. I love walking. Walking through a city opens up another dimension to the city (I think this is because since you are slow while walking you can observe more stuff ?!! (maybe idk! ))</p>
<h3>The Plan</h3>
<p>The plan is that there is no plan. I will pick up a place and I will borrow a camera and I will walk and then I will write about it and I will post it with the pics. Most of the pics will have some description about the image and what not. This is gonna be Kolkata as I see it. </p>
<p>Also I may end up using a cycle for my trek but I am not so sure about the cycle. </p></div>
