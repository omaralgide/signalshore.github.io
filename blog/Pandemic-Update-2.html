	<div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-body"><p>Its nearing almost 6 months since India went into a state of lock-down.</p>
<p>I travelled back home about 1 month back. The experience was
interesting. We all had to take precautions etc etc.</p>
<h2>Staying at Home</h2>
<p>I haven't stayed at home for longer than 3 weeks at a time since I
left home 5 years ago. It's been quite an experience. Having stayed
alone for years, it takes some time to get used to people being around
you all the time.</p>
<p>The lack of privacy and "alone-time" is noticeable and somewhat
disturbing during certain moments. As much as I enjoy being with these
people, I need to have some time to tone-down and be inside my own
head.</p>
<h2>Cleaning</h2>
<p>With Covid-19 all of our cleaning routines are on overdrive now and
big bottles/jars of alcohol based sanitizers are quite common now,
even though soap water also works. </p>
<h2>Work</h2>
<p>Work has been good. Apparently my performance was good enough that I
received a good promotion. This was most unexpected because I felt
that I was not doing good enough or that there was something more to
do always.</p>
<p>The promotion has been interesting. Apart from the technical
responsibilities, I have started making detailed plans for projects
and time estimates. Need to see how this plays out.</p>
<p>My recent project involves working with a distributed database which I
am enjoying a lot.</p>
<h2>Social Stuff</h2>
<p>I've been cutting down on my social media consumption for a while
now. I think I have it in control to a large extent. I think I will
start getting back on Instagram again. Not sure about it.</p>
<p>I spend a decent amount of time worrying about my friends who are
abroad, some of them are in the USA, some in Germany and some in other
cities in India. I'll admit, this covid-19 is scary. We are
privileged than most, but still.</p>
<h2>Reading</h2>
<p>I've been spending more time trying to read books. It's been good
overall. I read books when i get time from work and other learning in
general.</p>
<p>I want to make a "Reading" page for this blog where I can track
things. I do not want to use goodreads. It's easily done by generating
a page from my internal tracking org-mode file that I use, the catch
is that the output needs to be sanitized for the web. #TODO</p></div>
