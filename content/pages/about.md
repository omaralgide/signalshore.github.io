# About

<br> 
Name: Sohom.

I started SignalShore in 2017 because I really enjoy reading other
people's blogs and I wanted to have one for myself.

I dont know where I heard it but that really sums up what I try to live by.

I change my mind, review my beliefs and sharpen my opinions often, as
and when I learn new things. I am often wrong about a great many
things; hence the cycle of Read, Think, Reach your own conclusions
keeps repeating.

Writing this blog helps me write better and hence it help me think
better.

This blog is my excuse to try out new ideas, to learn new things and
to do it properly.

## "SignalShore" ? ##

I asked a friend for something "different". He suggested 4 names. This
was the only one that was available at that point. It's surprising
that this was not my first choice. Now that I think about it, the
hindi word for "noise" is "shore". So I guess I can say its something
to do with signal and noise.
