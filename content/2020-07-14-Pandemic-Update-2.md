Summary: Brief Update about the Pandemic and my work situation

Its nearing almost 6 months since India went into a state of lock-down.

I travelled back home about 1 month back. The experience was
interesting. We all had to take precautions etc etc.


## Staying at Home ##

I haven't stayed at home for longer than 3 weeks at a time since I
left home 5 years ago. It's been quite an experience. Having stayed
alone for years, it takes some time to get used to people being around
you all the time.

The lack of privacy and "alone-time" is noticeable and somewhat
disturbing during certain moments. As much as I enjoy being with these
people, I need to have some time to tone-down and be inside my own
head.


## Cleaning ##
With Covid-19 all of our cleaning routines are on overdrive now and
big bottles/jars of alcohol based sanitizers are quite common now,
even though soap water also works. 


## Work ##
Work has been good. Apparently my performance was good enough that I
received a good promotion. This was most unexpected. 

The past few weeks were bit rough. There was an overall lack of
direction and feeling overworked and a bit un-noticed at work. After
the promotion I got a chance to talk to some people that learnt that
the "I am not doing good enough" were just in my head.

The promotion has been interesting. Apart from the technical
responsibilities, I have started making detailed plans for projects
and time estimates. Need to see how this plays out.

I am also taking interviews of people for a position in our company. 

I sometimes feel out of my depth; but then again, there is hardly
anything productive that I can do other than keep studying and
growing.


## Social Stuff ##
I've been cutting down on my social media consumption for a while
now. I think I have it in control to a large extent. I think I will
start getting back on Instagram again. Not sure about it.

I spend a decent amount of time worrying about my friends who are
abroad, some of them are in the USA, some in Germany and some in other
cities in India. I'll admit, this covid-19 is scary. We are
privileged than most, but still.

## Reading ##
I've been spending more time trying to read books. It's been good
overall. I read books when i get time from work and other learning in
general.

I want to make a "Reading" page for this blog where I can track
things. I do not want to use goodreads. It's easily done by generating
a page from my internal tracking org-mode file that I use, the catch
is that the output needs to be sanitized for the web. #TODO
